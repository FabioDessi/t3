# tic tac toe vue.js

### Description
Basic vuejs with 2 components (MessageBoard and GameBoard), all the states are managed with a simplified form of Vuex (I didn't though Vuex was needed)
unit testing for isolated component and integration testing for App

The minimax algorithm seems more than enough to complete the task, for this reason i've skipped the backend part with database.
